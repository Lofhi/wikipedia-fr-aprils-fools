The Minitel/ASCII style was made by Lrq3000 for Wikipédia FR.

This project would have been impossible without other opensource projects and resources, thanks to them for making available their great resources.

Opensource softwares used were GIMP, Inkscape, the LAMPP test environment XAMPP, Filezilla and the banner was generated with the figlet generator npm figlet by patorjk.

This project uses images from other projects: the logo is a modified version of the Wikipedia logo v2 by the Wikimedia Foundation, and the April's Fools fish image is by the fish shell project.
